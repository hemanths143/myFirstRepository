If you want to use the command-line file transfer utility PSCP, you
will need to run this from a Command Prompt or equivalent, because it
will not do anything useful without command-line options telling it
what files to copy to and from where. You can do this by just running
the command 'pscp' from a Command Prompt, if you used the installer's
option to put the PuTTY installation directory on your PATH.
Alternatively, you can always run pscp.exe by its full pathname, e.g.
"C:\Program Files\PuTTY\pscp.exe".
